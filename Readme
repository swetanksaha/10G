Driver compilation and installation
===================================

To get the make options type make help
  make help

tn40xx driver Makefile. Available targets:
  all              - build the driver
  clean            - Clean the driver
  help             - Print this help message
  install          - Install driver to system directory
                     usually, it is /lib/modules/VER/kernel/drivers/net
  default          - all

Special notes for Marvell PHYs:
===============================
	This driver package does not include Marvell PHY firmware files. If you own a TN9210 or TN9710 NIC based on Marvell PHY, you will need to obtain the firmware file in .hdr format prior to compiling this driver from either your NIC manufacturer or from Marvell directly

	For TN9210 (DeviceID 4024) please extract the file 88X3140-FW-R02-06-03.hdr from 88X3140-FW-R02-06-03.zip
	For TN9710P (DeviceID 4027) please obtain the file x3310fw_0_2_8_0_8850.hdr
	For TN9710Q (DeviceID 4527) please obtain the file e2010fw_0_2_8_0_8850.hdr

	If you are missing these exact files, the driver will compile without support for these PHYs
